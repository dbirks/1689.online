## Paragraph 1

The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience, **a** although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet they are not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and His will which is necessary unto salvation. **b** Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in diversified manners to reveal Himself, and to declare (that) His will unto His church; **c** and afterward for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which makes the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God's revealing His will unto His people being now completed. **d**

### 2 Timothy 3:15-17

**15** and that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. **16** Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness: **17** that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.

### Romans 1:19-21

**19** because that which is known of God is manifest in them; for God manifested it unto them. **20** For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse: **21** because that, knowing God, they glorified him not as God, neither gave thanks; but became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened.

**Romans 2:14-15**

**14** (for when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are the law unto themselves; **15** in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing them );

### Psalm 19:1-3

**1** The heavens declare the glory of God;  
And the firmament showeth his handiwork.  
**2** Day unto day uttereth speech,  
And night unto night showeth knowledge.  
**3** There is no speech nor language;  
Their voice is not heard.

That thou mayest carry back words of truth to them that send thee?

## Paragraph 3

{{%expand "Scripture: f" %}}

### Luke 24:27,44

**27** And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.  
**44** And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.

{{% /expand%}}

## Paragraph 4

The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, depends not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore it is to be received because it is the Word of God. **g**

### 2 Peter 1:19-21

**19** And we have the word of prophecy made more sure; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts: **20** knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation. **21** For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.

**9** If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for the witness of God is this, that he hath borne witness concerning his Son.

## Paragraph 5

We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church of God to a high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man's salvation, and many other incomparable excellencies, and entire perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it does abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts. **h**

### John 16:13,14

**13** Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, these shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come. **14** He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare it unto you.

### 1 Corinthians 2:10-12

**10** But unto us God revealed them through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. **11** For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God. **12** But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.

### 1 John 2:20,27

## Paragraph 6

The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for His own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelation of the Spirit, or traditions of men. **i**  Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word, **j** and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed. **k**

### 2 Timothy 3:15-17

**15** Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth. **16** But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness, **17** and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: or whom is Hymenaeus an Philetus;

**9** but as it is written, Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, And which entered not into the heart of man, Whatsoever things God prepared for them that love him. **10** But unto us God revealed them through the Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. **11** For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of the man, which is in him? even so the things of God none knoweth, save the Spirit of God. **12** But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.

## Paragraph 7

All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all; **l** yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means, may attain to a sufficient understanding of them. **m**

## Paragraph 8

The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of God of old), **n** and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by His singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal to them. **o** But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read, **p** and search them, **q** therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come, **r** that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship Him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope. **s**

### 1 Corinthians 14:6,9,11,12,24,28

**6** But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?  
**9** So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air.  
**11** If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me. **12** So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual gifts , seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church.  
**24** But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;  
**28** but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.

## Paragraph 10

The supreme judge, by which all controversies of religion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Scripture delivered by the Spirit, into which Scripture so delivered, our faith is finally resolved. **u**
